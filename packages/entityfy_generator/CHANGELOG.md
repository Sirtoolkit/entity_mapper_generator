## 2.0.0

### Added
- **🎯 Dual Model Generation**: Complete support for generating both Entity classes and UI Model classes from a single annotation
- **📝 Comprehensive Class Generation**: Auto-generates complete classes with constructors, `fromJson()`, and `toJson()` methods
- **🔄 Bidirectional Mapping**: Support for both `toEntity()` and `toUiModel()` mapper extensions
- **⚙️ Flexible Configuration**: New `@Entityfy` annotation with boolean flags for `generateEntity` and `generateUiModel`
- **🏗️ Combined Generator Architecture**: Unified code generation in a single file with `.entityfy.g.dart` extension
- **🔍 Smart Naming Convention**: Automatic class naming (`CustomerModel` → `CustomerEntity` + `CustomerUiModel`)
- **📊 Enhanced Type Conversion**: Intelligent type mapping for nested models, lists, and complex data structures
- **🛡️ Type Safety**: Full compile-time type checking and validation

### Features
- Sequential generation of Entity classes, UI Model classes, and their respective mappers
- Support for DateTime serialization with ISO8601 format
- Proper nullable type handling throughout the generation process
- Enhanced List type support with element type casting
- Deep nested model support with automatic `toEntity()` and `toUiModel()` calls
- Comprehensive constructor parameter analysis and mapping

### Breaking Changes
- Replaced multiple individual annotations with unified `@Entityfy` annotation
- Changed file extension from individual generators to combined `.entityfy.g.dart`
- Updated API to use boolean flags instead of separate annotation classes

## 1.2.0

### Added
- **Nested Model Support**: Automatic conversion of nested models annotated with `@EntityMapper` by calling their `toEntity()` methods
- **List Support**: Complete handling of `List<T>` where `T` is an annotated model, automatically applying `.map((e) => e.toEntity()).toList()`
- **Smart Type Detection**: Intelligent differentiation between primitive types, nested models, and lists for appropriate conversion strategies
- **Constructor Analysis**: Deep examination of entity constructor parameters to ensure correct field mapping

### Features
- Generates clean, readable code with organized extension methods
- Build-time code generation with zero runtime dependencies
- Type-safe mapping with compile-time verification
- Support for complex nested data structures

## 1.1.0

### Changed
- Updated dependencies in pubspec.yaml, aligning with the latest versions of `source_gen`, `build`, and `analyzer`
- Refactored `mapper_generator.dart` to utilize updated element classes, enhancing compatibility with the new API structure

## 1.0.0

- Initial version.
